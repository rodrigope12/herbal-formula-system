Logic
 
OBJECTIVE
 
OF
 
THE
 
SCORING
 
SYSTEM
 
The
 
scoring
 
logic
 
has
 
three
 
main
 
functions:
 
●
 
Prioritize
 
real
 
clinical
 
objectives
 
(not
 
just
 
preferences)
 
●
 
Determine
 
system
 
hierarchy
 
(what
 
to
 
address
 
first)
 
●
 
Guide
 
plant
 
selection
 
and
 
weighting
 
within
 
the
 
formula
 
The
 
system
 
does
 
not
 
diagnose;
 
it
 
evaluates
 
functional
 
states
 
and
 
guides
 
safe,
 
coherent
 
formulation
 
decisions.
 
GENERAL
 
STRUCTURE
 
OF
 
THE
 
SCORING
 
SYSTEM
 
1.
 
Base
 
scale
 
by
 
category
 
Each
 
category
 
is
 
scored
 
using
 
a
 
0–10
 
slider,
 
where:
 
●
 
0–2
 
→
 
no
 
clinical
 
relevance
 
●
 
3–4
 
→
 
mild
 
●
 
5–6
 
→
 
moderate
 
●
 
7–8
 
→
 
high
 
●
 
9–10
 
→
 
priority
 
/
 
primary
 
axis
 
Categories
 
evaluated:
 
●
 
Sleep
 
●
 
Stress
 
/
 
anxiety
 
●
 
Digestion
 
●
 
Energy
 
/
 
fatigue
 
●
 
Mental
 
clarity
 
and
 
focus
 
●
 
Immunity
 
and
 
recovery
 
2.
 
Relative
 
weighting
 
between
 
categories
 
Not
 
all
 
categories
 
carry
 
the
 
same
 
clinical
 
weight.
 
The
 
following
 
base
 
weighting
 
is
 
proposed:
 
●
 
Sleep
 
→
 
×1.3
 
●
 
Stress
 
/
 
anxiety
 
→
 
×1.3
 
●
 
Digestion
 
→
 
×1.3
 
●
 
Energy
 
/
 
fatigue
 
→
 
×1.1
 
●
 
Mental
 
clarity
 
/
 
focus
 
→
 
×1.0
 
 
 
 
●
 
Immunity
 
/
 
recovery
 
→
 
×1.0
 
Clinical
 
rationale:
 
Sleep,
 
stress,
 
and
 
digestion
 
are
 
primary
 
regulatory
 
systems
 
that
 
directly
 
impact
 
the
 
others.

Detection
 
of
 
dominant
 
axes
 
Once
 
scores
 
are
 
weighted,
 
the
 
system
 
identifies:
 
●
 
1
 
primary
 
axis
 
(highest
 
final
 
score)
 
●
 
1–2
 
secondary
 
axes
 
(close
 
scores)
 
Rule:
 
●
 
No
 
more
 
than
 
3
 
active
 
axes
 
per
 
formula
 
●
 
Prevents
 
diffuse
 
or
 
overly
 
complex
 
formulations
 
Example:
 
●
 
Sleep
 
(8.5
 
weighted)
 
→
 
primary
 
axis
 
●
 
Stress
 
(7.9
 
weighted)
 
→
 
secondary

●
 
Digestion
 
(6.8
 
weighted)
 
→
 
functional
 
support
 
5.
 
Transversal
 
modulators
 
(fine
 
adjustments)
 
Modulators
 
do
 
not
 
create
 
a
 
new
 
axis,
 
but
 
modify
 
the
 
formulation.
 
Typical
 
modulators:
 
●
 
low-grade
 
inflammation
 
●
 
brain
 
fog
 
●
 
muscle
 
tension
 
●
 
nighttime
 
digestion
 
●
 
mental
 
hyperactivation
 
Rule:
 
Each
 
modulator
 
may:
 
●
 
adjust
 
proportions
 
●
 
activate
 
or
 
exclude
 
specific
 
plants
 
●
 
modify
