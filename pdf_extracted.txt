A full-stack logistics platform designed to optimize delivery routes for small-to-medium businesses. It solves theVehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with real-world constraints (security waypoints) and features an Offline-Firstmobile application for drivers.TECHFASTAPI | REACT NATIVE | OR-TOOLS | GOOGLE CLOUD
 Intelligent Route Optimization: Uses Google OR-Tools to calculate the most efficient delivery sequence,minimizing distance and time.
 Security Constraints: Implements hard constraints (e.g., Mandatory Security Checkpoints in high-riskzones like Huichapan) directly into the routing algorithm.
 Offline-First Mobile App: React Native app capable of syncing data seamlessly. Drivers can completedeliveries and capture proof-of-delivery even without internet access.
 Dynamic Dashboard: Real-time visualization of orders, prospects, and routes using Google Sheets as aflexible, zero-cost database.
 Automated Invoicing: Generates PDF receipts and WhatsApp logs automatically upon deliverycompletion.ComponentTechDescriptionBackendPython, FastAPIHigh-performance API handling VRP logic and data sync.OptimizationGoogle OR-ToolsConstraint programming solver for complex routing logistics.Mobile AppReact Native (Expo)Cross-platform driver application with background sync.DatabaseGoogle Sheets APICloud-native, user-friendly database for easy client management.GeospatialGoogle Maps APIPlaces, Directions, and Distance Matrix for precise navigation.
